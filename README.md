# About the Project

i-migrate aims to address the difficulty of researching and locating the correct resources to understand the eligibility requirements for immigration paperwork. The immigrant/refugee/asylum seekers traditionally have to visit local governmental immigration offices or talk to an immigration lawyer to understand the path to residency in their destination country away from home. This process can be **ambiguous**, **hard to understand** and **lengthy** for even one country. The problem compounds in **complexity** as alternative destination countries are to be compared with each other in terms of the benefits each country provides to its residents. For example, many students applying to universities have to consider the length of lawful residence allowed post-graduation to look for jobs and interview. This may be a factor in influencing the student’s decision to choose one country over another. Some countries provide a faster pathway to citizenship counting education years as part of ‘physical residency’ towards the eligibility requirement while others do not consider this length in their calculation.

# Usage

i-migrate provides a one-stop shop that encapsulates the major immigration requirements for some European countries. The app gathers the qualification requirements to obtain a visa, residency or asylum in a selected country. The users first select their country of origin, and their country of destination where they consider migrating to. They then provide basic information such as ethnicity, nationality, partner’s nationality, occupation, educational background. The app generates a recommendation based on these inputs, and provides a ranking of applicable visa/residency/asylum categories. The recommendation includes the economic benefits to the immigrant as well as the legal pathway to permanent residency/citizenship. The app is an easy to use platform to compare different countries with respect to the benefits they offer.
